    <section class="ingredients">
        <h3>For the Soup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>30g finely grated hard cheese, e.g. Parmesan</li>
	    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
	    <li>1 large onion (200g), chopped</li>
	    <li>1 large clove of garlic, chopped</li>
	    <li>100ml cream (regular or double)</li>
	    <li>salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
	    <li>2 courgettes (zucchini) (350g in weight altogether)</li>
            <li>800ml vegetable or chicken stock</li>
            <li>8 large basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Croutons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 slices of delicious white bread or sourdough</li>
	    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Aïoli</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
	    <li>a pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves of garlic, finely grated or crushed</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>175ml tasteless oil, such as canola oil</li>
            <li>50ml extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 scant tablespoon chopped parsley <em>(Derek's Tips: I just use dried parsley here rather than buying an entire bunch of parsley)</em></li>
        </ul>

    <section class="instructions">
     <h3>For the Aïoli</h3>
        <p>Put the egg yolks into a bowl with the salt, mustard, garlic and the white wine vinegar.</p>
        <p>Put the oils in a jug. With a whisk in one hand and the jug in the other, drizzle the oil on to the egg yolks in a very thin, steady stream, whisking all the time. Be sure to let the oil emulsify into the egg yolks as you're whisking, i.e. don't pour the oil in too quickly or the mixture will split.</p>
        <p>Within a minute you should notice the mixture beginning to thicken. Continue until you've used all the oil. Mix in the parsley, taste and add a little more seasoning and vinegar if necessary <em>(Derek's Tips: I usually also add some lemon juice to taste)</em>. Store, covered, in the fridge, for up to 1 week.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Note:</strong></em> <em>If the aïoli splits it will suddenly become thin and watery. To rectify this, pour the split mixture into the oil jug and place an extra egg yolk in a clean bowl. Whisking all the time, pour the split mixture on to the yolk in a very thin stream.</em></p>
      <h3>For the Soup & Croutons</h3>
        <p>Place the olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, season with salt and pepper. Put the saucepan lid on and reduce the heat to low, then cook gently for about 10 minutes, until the onions are tender <em>(Derek's Tips: you don't want to brown the onions or the garlic here, you're just looking for a Mirepoix)</em>. Add the courgettes (zucchini), then cover again and cook for another 3-4 minutes, until the courgettes (zucchini) are just tender.</p>
        <p>Now add the stock, bring the mixture to the boil over a high heat and boil for 1 minute. Take off the heat, add the basil leaves, grated cheese and cream, and blend until smooth. Season to taste.</p>
        <p>Preheat the grill to high. Slice the crusts from the bread and discard. Cut the bread into 3cm chunks and toss them in a bowl with the olive oil. Tip on to a baking tray, spreading the croutons out in a single layer, and place under the grill for 2-3 minutes, turning them and giving the tray a shake halfway through, until the croutons are golden brown. <em>(Derek's Tips: Instead of a grill, I just use the oven broiler on high, checking for doneness at 3 minutes, and then if they're not done checking again every 30 seconds. The croutons will continue to darken in color after you remove them from the heat, so take them out when they're slightly lighter than golden brown)</em></p>
        <p>Allow to cool slightly, then place a small dollop of aïoli on each crouton and place on top of each bowl of hot soup.</p>
